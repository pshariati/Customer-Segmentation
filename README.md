# Customer-Segmentation

Unsupervised clustering analysis to identify meaningful customer segments from demographic and purchasing behavior data.

## Overview
This project segments customers using KMeans and hierarchical clustering to improve marketing efficiency and retention strategies.  
Includes:
- Feature engineering and normalization  
- Elbow method and silhouette analysis for cluster selection  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) for visualization  
- Comparison of clustering approaches  

## Data
Data includes customer demographics, spending across product categories, and purchase channels.  
> **Note:** Dataset not included.

## Methods
- **Algorithms:** KMeans, Agglomerative (Ward/Complete/Average Linkage)  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, scipy  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Silhouette score, cluster visualization  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA  

## Reproducing Results
1. Preprocess and scale features.  
2. Run KMeans across K values and compute silhouette scores.  
3. Compare hierarchical linkage methods and select best-performing model.  
4. Visualize clusters in PCA space and interpret profiles.

## Notes
- Final model used hierarchical clustering (Ward linkage, 2 clusters) with silhouette score â‰ˆ 0.29.  
- PCA used to support interpretable visualization of customer groups.
